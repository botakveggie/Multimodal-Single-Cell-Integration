Preprocessing for the input/RNA data

1. `aws_preprocess.py` used to preprocess the whole `data/train_cite_inputs.h5`, as well as converting  `data/train_cite_targets.h5` to .csv

2. `preprocess.py` used to preprocess subset of `data/train_cite_inputs.h5`, as well as converting  `data/train_cite_targets.h5` to .csv

3. `preprocess_umap.py` was used for optimising parameters

4. `preprocess_utils.py` contains functions used for preprocessing
